Minecraft Mod for Fabric/Quilt loader. **requires Fabric API or QSL**.\
it started as a fork of [Leaves Us In Peace](https://modrinth.com/mod/leaves-us-in-peace) for latest version, but i decided to clean up the dependencies to make it sustainable.
## What it does

Leaves will ignore leaves of a different type when determining whether to decay or not.\
Leaves will ignore logs from different tree types when determining whether to decay or not.\
